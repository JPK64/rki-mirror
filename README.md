## RKI Mirror

This project is a web app for an overview over the german corona incidences in
your state and district. It uses the incidences published daily by the
Robert-Koch-Institute.

This repository is a reboot of the former repository due to me being dumb and
accidentally leaking my personal information.

### About

This web server is built using [Quarkus](https://quarkus.io/). It can thus be
built into a native image (provided you have [GraalVM Native Image](https://www.graalvm.org/reference-manual/native-image/)
installed). Said image does not need a Java VM, making Quarkus a lightweight and
fast alternative to other Frameworks such as Spring Boot.

The web server provides only a single REST resource, providing the data of the
configured state and district. To achieve this, the server periodically
downloads the [Excel spreadsheet](https://www.rki.de/DE/Content/InfAZ/N/Neuartiges_Coronavirus/Daten/Fallzahlen_Kum_Tab.xlsx)
published daily by the RKI and retrieves the incidence data from there.

I have considered using an API like https://api.corona-zahlen.org/. However,
they do not provide the frozen incidence data for german states which is the
data I am interested in.

The frontend is done with [React](https://reactjs.org/).

#### Corona incidences

The lockdown in Germany is regulated by the corona incidences published by the
RKI. The lower the incidences, the lower the incidence level, resulting in less
strict lockdown policies.

Each incidence level has a threshold. If the corona incidences are below that
threshold for 5 consecutive days, the incidence level is reached. If the
incidences are above that threshold for 3 consecutive days (or 8 consecutive
days for incidence level 0), the next incidence level the incidences were below
for these 3 days is reached. An incidence level change always occurs after two
days.

If the incidence is above the threshold for the third incidence level, the
policies provided by the german [Infection Control Act ยง28b](https://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/ifsg/__28b.html)
are used instead of state and district policies.

The incidence level thresholds are the following:

| Incidence Level | Threshold |
| --- | --- |
| 0 | 10 |
| 1 | 35 |
| 2 | 50 |
| 3 | 100 |

### Configuration

For the frontend icons, see `src/main/typescript/public/manifest.json` for the
icons you need to provide.

In src/main/typescript:

| File | Contains |
| --- | --- |
| public/index.html | Web app title and noscript message |
| public/manifest.json | The web app manifest. See https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/web-app-manifest/ |
| public/robots.txt | See http://www.robotstxt.org/ |
| src/theme.scss | The theme styling |

In src/main/resources:

| File | Contains |
| --- | --- |
| application.properties | Quarkus and web server configuration |

In config:

| File | Contains |
| --- | --- |
| application.properties | Resource and service configuration |
| frontend.json | Frontend configuration, downloaded by the React frontend |

#### Changing Ports, Disabling SSL

When deploying the web server, the production build will use SSL by default. It
will also redirect insecure HTTP requests on port `80` to secure HTTPS on port
`443`. The web server will attempt to find the SSL certificate files `web.crt`
and `web.key` in it's current working directory.

In order to change any of this stuff, edit
`src/main/resources/application.properties` or override the properties you want
to change in `config/application.properties`.

I would advise against this as SSL certificates are easy to get. If you have SSH
access to your web server or if your web provider supports it, you can even use
[Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/getting-started/) to generate SSL
certificates for free. There is no real reason not to use SSL.

### Building

Please note that for building the jar file, you need a working JDK as well as
Maven.

First provide the missing properties in `config/application.properties`. Then
compile the TypeScipt and Java files and package them into a Jar file using
`mvn package`. Said Jar file can directly be built into a native image by adding
the `-Pnative` flag to the Maven command.

Maven is also configured to make to tarballs - one containing the generated Jar
files and their dependencies and the other containing the external configuration
files provided in the `config` directory.

### Deployment

The tarball containing the Jar files contains everything needed to run the web
server with a JVM. The native image is a static executable and can be executed
directly.

The `config` directory has to be in the current working directory of the web
server in order for the configuration files to be found by the web server.

### Development

The React components are written in TypeScript and can be found in the
`src/main/typescript` directory. The Java files can be found in the
`src/main/java` directory, `email.preuschoff.rki.App` being the application
class. Resources providing the endpoints can be found in
`de.vflkamen.server.app.resource`.

To start the web server in development mode with live coding enabled, use
`maven quarkus:dev`. The endpoints can then be reached via
http://localhost:8080.

To start the React frontend in development mode with live
coding enabled, navigate to `src/main/typescript` and run npm start. The
frontend can then be reached via http://localhost:3000. Please note that the
frontend downloads the data from the quarkus web server, so running the quarkus
server alongside the frontend server is required.

### Issues and Feature Requests

Please use the GitHub issues tracker for issues. You can also post feature
requests there, but keep in mind that I started this project mainly for the
sports club I'm in, so I may only implement your feature requests when I feel
like they are a good feature for said sports club to have.

Feel free to fork this project if any of your feature requests don't make it in!
